# 42 GetNextLine
## Function that returns a line read from a file descriptor

Main goal of this project is to create function that will read any valid file, given as parameter, line by line till the end.
“line” is a succession of characters that end with ’\n’ (ascii code 0x0a) or with End Of File (EOF).
Each time function return readed line. 

Of course you can read file lines, using standart C library, but in our case we needed to create our own function, using read, malloc, free and libft functions that we created earlier. 

The project make student more confident with files manipulations, dynamic memory allocation and using pointers, arrays and linked lists.

In my opinion, this one of the two most important functions at 42 School. This function and ft_printf(next project) were used in next projects a lot. 

Also we get familiarized with static variables in this project.
